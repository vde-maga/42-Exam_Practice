# 42 - Exam Practice

In this repository I keep all the exercise solutions I've done, as a way of preparing for the different exams I've taken here at 42 Porto. To simulate the exam experience as much as possible, I used the [grade.me](https://grademe.com.br/) tool.

## Exam Rank 02

For Exam Rank 02, GradeMe doesn't show all the possible exercises that could be used in the exam, so I recommend checking the possible ones via [42 Cursus Gitbook](https://42-cursus.gitbook.io/guide/exams/exam-rank-02). In my case, I made a checklist of all the possible ones and tried to solve them all at least once, so that I would be familiar with the exercises. I would check that what I had done was right with other codes on the internet or by uploading the code to GradeMe when possible.
